==== Providence/Clarity Todo ====

-- add actual code to storage API for easy storage of data to blobstore and webstorage
-- add parent for receiver extension (data handler) to enforce existence of important methods (process_data)
-- add facility to return uniform API responses, perhaps a central APIResponseObject?
-- add facility to decorate functions that need API authentication (@api_method)?
-- add exception handling (and exceptions) to receiver class
-- fill out descriptor classes, figure out automatic system to pull descriptors related to a module
-- make things like analyzer automatically pull related descriptors, inject them into config
-- implement exception instead of lazy fail for loading pc_config file (/__init__.py)
-- add fallback to regular from_protobuf for de-encoding of PB's. (api/cache/__init__.py)
-- add localization to exceptions
-- find a way to store importerrors/proto errors/other db errors in the database
-- find out what to do with the results of proto operations - store in db?
-- make model path seperator (defaults to ':') customizable
-- make CachedProtobufList property work and fix attachments property on QueuedTransaction
-- move descriptor API under data API
-- add XML encoding for API responders
-- error handling for type decisions in the data API
-- make and use exceptions for input (receiver/scraper) class
-- write scraper and receiver code
-- error handling for handlers/workers (with automatic dump of error to client through API)



DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP:

-- v1.5 DEV:
	-Working schema for descriptors and protos.
	-Automatic proto-management methods
	-Automatic input (receiver/scraper) methods

-- v1.6 DEV:
	-Rewritten components to bring out of DEV and into ALPHA state.
	-Support for multitenancy.
	-Prototype that accepts input via working receivers/scrapers, automatically passes through working object
	and relation analyzers, stores analyzed data, and outputs basic (XHTML/table based) visualizations.

-- v1.7 DEV:
	-Basic working graph visualizer, basic chart generator, hooked up to object CRUD interface.
	
-- v1.8 ALPHA:
	-Working index generator, and index normalizer.
	-Working cache generator, and cache manager.
	-Working statistics analyzer.
	
-- v2.0 BETA:
	-Fully-built data API, input API, output API
	-Application strings moved to Babel
	-PolyModel-independent data schema that uses normalized, derived entity indexes instead of a single
	object kind and related entity indexes.
	-Graph generator that leverages statistics data to place/color/mark entities.
